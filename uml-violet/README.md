UML with Violet
===========

The UML diagrams of this folder are made using the Violet
UML Editor program: http://sourceforge.net/projects/violet/

Violet certainly looks prettier than the Eclipse UML editor
in the /uml/ directory. But I find that it becomes exceedingly
frustrating to use as your diagrams become bigger and more
complex. Furthermore, the font that it uses sometimes makes
text hard to read, and while the editor is very simple, it
does not offer much control over how the final diagrams look.

Having said that, it sure is super easy to use.
