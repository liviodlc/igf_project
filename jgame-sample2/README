JGame

The setup was a breeze.  Dropped 1 jar in, hooked it up to the buildpath and was good to go

This engine will support separate states.  This is important because states are what determine things like pause menus, splash screen, transitions, etc.
The support for states is just based on variables in the code. It looks like the StdGame can be extended and variables can be changed - I'll be applying a conclusive test of this later.

So far, their collision seems tile based, so we can
1) make all the sprites/interactable elements be based on the tile sizes
2) write our own collisions <- this could be a pain and bug filled route

I'm not really sure about the background (especially the parallax scrolling) at this point.  The tutorials I've found so far have just slapped a background picture on and were done with it

I'm also not sure about the camera. Currently it looks doable(and I have a tutorial for something that I believe is camera), so I'm cautiously optimistic.

So far, I'm liking the straight-forwardness of this engine in comparison to Slick's many class approach, and there seems to be a good bit of useful documentation on the website itself, plus an API
