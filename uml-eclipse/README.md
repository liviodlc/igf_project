UML with Eclipse
===========

The UML diagrams of this folder are made using an Eclipse plugin
called MDT-UML2Tools: http://wiki.eclipse.org/MDT-UML2Tools

Here's a tutorial on how to install and use this plugin:

Even though this editor installed quite a few things to Eclipse
in order to work, and it doesn't feel as smooth as Violet, I find
the level of freedom and control found in this UML editor to be
really refreshing. Although, I've never used the editor on a full
project before, so we'd certainly be taking a risk by  using a
new tool.
